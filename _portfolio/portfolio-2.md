The schematic vertical cross sections for HYMACS are depicted as follows: (a) the scale of a convective updraft and a mass-compensating environment compared with the size of grid columns; (b) how subgrid-scale mass convergence or divergence is treated in a grid column; and (c) how grid-scale dynamics respond to the subgrid-scale mass source and sink.
