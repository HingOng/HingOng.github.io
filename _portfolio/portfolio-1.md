A schematic diagram illustrating the effect of the nontraditional Coriolis term (NCT) on the geopotential height of an isobaric surface (From [Ong and Roundy 2020](https://hingong.github.io/publication/2019-11-19-paper-title-number-3)) 

The nontraditional Coriolis terms (NCTs) represent components of [Coriolis force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force#E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_effect) that turn eastward motion upward and upward motion westward, and vice versa.
