A schematic diagram illustrating the effect of the nontraditional Coriolis term (NCT) on the geopotential height of an isobaric surface (From [Ong and Roundy 2020](https://hingong.github.io/publication/2019-11-19-paper-title-number-3)) 

NCTs represent components of [Coriolis force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force#E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_effect) that turn eastward motion upward and upward motion westward, and vice versa.

Motivation
====

Traditional Approximation
----

Most of the current global atmospheric models use the hydrostatic [primitive equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_equations) to predict atmospheric motion. Because of the use of the [hydrostatic equation](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equation), omitting NCTs, so-called the traditional approximation in geophysical fluid dynamics, is needed for dynamical consistency and energy conservation.

Modern Application
----

On the pathway toward relaxing the hydrostatic approximation, many models restore the vertical acceleration term but not NCTs.

Traditional-Modern Inconsistency
----

NCTs are omitted for the use of the hydrostatic equation. According to a scale analysis, vertical acceleration term is far smaller than the vertical NCT for a horizontal length scale of 100 km or larger.

Summary
====

In linear models, NCTs affect the flow response to heat sources by ~10%, and the hypsometric relation by ~5%, and the equatorial wave phase speed by ~0.25 m/s, or the meridional vorticity tendency associated with the [Madden–Julian oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden%E2%80%93Julian_oscillation) by ~10%. Unlike many numerical errors in the models, these effects don’t start small and grow large with time integration. Instead, omitting these effects biases the initial pressure-height relation and biases the zonal wind and wave propagation every time step. These biases may grow even larger if nonlinear processes are considered, which is left for future studies. These results encourage restoring NCTs into the models for more-accurate simulations for tropical large-scale flow. This restoration is not going to resolve all the problems, and the importance of improving the representation of physical processes is not downgraded. However, the restoration of NCTs should be among the top priorities of model development, because all other parts of the development depend on the choice of governing equations.

Broader Impact
====

My Ph.D. dissertation suggests that NCTs are considerable in tropical large-scale atmospheric dynamics, but NCTs are omitted in most of the current global models. The ongoing work may further improve our understanding of effects of NCTs and may also lead the weather and climate modeling community to include NCTs into their models to improve prediction, which improves our lives.
