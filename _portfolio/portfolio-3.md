A schematic diagram illustrating changes in isentropic surfaces (black) and a vorticity tube (vorticity in green and velocity rings perpendicular to it in blue) that are (a) originally in parallel and have undergone (b) adiabatic tilting and (c) diabatic tilting

Motivation
====

Potential vorticity (PV) field uniquely (given boundary conditions) describes the balanced (quasi-hydrostatic and gradient wind) part of atmospheric flow. PV is conserved in adiabatic and frictionless flow. While diabatic heating or cooling can change the balanced and unbalanced (e.g., gravity waves) parts of the flow, studying diabatic effects on PV is important because it untangles the changes in the balanced part of the flow from coupling with the unbalanced part. In the pioneering study on PV by [Hoskins et al. (1985)](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.49711147002), they pointed out that diabatic heating or cooling changes PV mainly through diabatic streching for quasi-geostrophic balanced flow (small [Rossby number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_number)), and then they dropped the diabatic tilting term in the PV equation. However, some later studies dropped the diabatic tilting term without considering the possibility of its importance given the large Rossby number, leaving me wondering.

Summary
====

The accepted paper reinterprets tilting of vorticity from along-isentropic (horizontal) to cross-isentropic (vertical) as along-isentropic flux of PV due to cross-isentropic momentum transport. Through this process, given vertically sheared winds, latent heat release in convective clouds tends to yield a pair of opposite signed PV without the need of preexisting PV.

Broader Impact
====

The accepted paper gives insight into how convective clouds can change a weather system because, generally, the balanced part of the change stays in the weather system while the unbalanced part disperses with gravity waves. Such insight may lead to improvement in weather prediction.

Project Status
====

My ongoing side project (2018-). I have been thinking about this process, analyzing it with data, and presenting about it in conferences. However, I had not found the motives to compose a paper about it until I read Hitchman and Rowe (2019) and peer-reviewed their subsequent paper. The comment-reply correspondence was a pleasant experience.
