A schematic diagram illustrating changes in isentropic surfaces (black) and a vorticity tube (vorticity in green and velocity rings perpendicular to it in blue) that are (a) originally in parallel and have undergone (b) adiabatic tilting and (c) diabatic tilting

Motivation
====

Potential vorticity (PV) field uniquely (given boundary conditions) describes the balanced (quasi-hydrostatic and gradient wind) part of atmospheric flow. PV is conserved in adiabatic and frictionless flow. While diabatic heating or cooling can change the balanced and unbalanced (e.g., gravity waves) parts of the flow, studying diabatic effects on PV is important because it untangles the changes in the balanced part of the flow from coupling with the unbalanced part. In the pioneering study on PV by [Hoskins et al. (1985)](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.49711147002), they pointed out that diabatic heating or cooling changes PV mainly through diabatic streching for quasi-geostrophic balanced flow (small [Rossby number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_number)), and then they dropped the diabatic tilting term in the PV equation. However, some later studies dropped the diabatic tilting term without considering the possibility of its importance given the large Rossby number, leaving me wondering.
