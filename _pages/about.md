I am Hing Ong, a Postdoctoral Appointee at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/), studying atmospheric dynamics and modeling.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been pioneering the advances in atmospheric modeling. I apply modeling approaches to untangle the intricacy of atmospheric physics and leverage this knowledge to drive the evolution of atmospheric modeling itself. My previous research has been dedicated to investigating [tropical large-scale atmospheric dynamics](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/), [atmospheric convection](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/), and atmospheric rivers. These studies not only enhanced our understanding of the physical processes but also contributed substantial evolutions in the representation of these processes in state-of-the-art atmospheric models. Furthermore, my work has inspired my peers to elevate their own modeling endeavors. I am committed to continuing to make significant contributions to Earth system modeling through independent research supported by external funding.

In addition to my research expertise, I possess substantial experience in teaching Earth system subjects at the higher education level. I have also ventured into the forefront of teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects using the Tâigí (Taiwanese Hokkien) language—a language seldom used for STEM education. Within the realm of higher education, I teach courses in atmospheric dynamics, modeling, and related subjects, with a strong focus on nurturing critical-thinking and problem-solving skills in my students. Moreover, I have taken the initiative to develop [Tâigí STEM](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093530741823) education materials from the ground up and provide online tutoring to Tâigí-speaking students worldwide. My goal is not only to educate but to inspire others, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the field of STEM education.
