I am Hing Ong, a Postdoctoral Appointee at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/). Throughout my career, I have been at the forefront of advancements in atmospheric dynamics and modeling, contributing to a deeper understanding of [atmospheric rivers](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/) (with a paper accepted by Nature Communications), [tropical large-scale atmospheric dynamics](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/), and [atmospheric convection](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/). I also have extensive experience teaching university-level Earth system sciences and am deeply committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.

In my research, I develop models of varying complexities to explore the intricacies of atmospheric physics, advancing the evolution of atmospheric models. These efforts have not only deepened our understanding of critical physical processes but also improved their representation in state-of-the-art models. My work has inspired colleagues to refine their modeling techniques as well. Ultimately, my goal is to improve atmospheric modeling for more-accurate prediction and better understanding of weather and climate.

As an educator, I prioritize critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while providing personalized mentorship to help students identify and build on their strengths. Additionally, I have pioneered the teaching of STEM subjects in Tâigí (Taiwanese Hokkien), a language rarely used for STEM education. I have developed original STEM materials in Tâigí and offer online tutoring to Tâigí-speaking students worldwide ([Tâigí STEM](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093530741823)). My goal is to inspire and mentor the next generation of scientists while fostering greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM fields.
