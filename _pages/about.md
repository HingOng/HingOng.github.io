I am Hing Ong, a Postdoctoral Appointee at Argonne National Laboratory, working in [Dr. Rao Kotamarthi's research group](https://www.anl.gov/profile/rao-kotamarthi). Welcome to my academic personal website.

I study atmospheric dynamics and modeling. The overarching goal is to improve atmospheric modeling for more-accurate prediction and better understanding of weather and climate.

My expertise in atmospheric model formulation has enabled me to accomplish a wide range of work.
(1) [Nontraditional Coriolis terms](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/). I formulated a few idealized atmospheric models to better understand the significance of a traditionally neglected effect (nontraditional Coriolis terms, or NCTs) of Earth rotation in the tropical atmosphere. I restored NCTs to the dynamical core of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) and the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM).
(2) [Dynamic compensation of convective mass flux](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/). I formulated a convective parameterization scheme to better represent the interaction between small-scale convection and large-scale environmental flow and implemented the scheme in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.
(3) Physical processes of atmospheric rivers. I analyzed reanalysis data to better understand the physical processes driving atmospheric rivers.

I am also interested in teaching. I usually volunteer to teach whenever I see an opportunity; for example, I served as a teaching assistant when I was a graduate student at National Taiwan University and University at Albany, State University of New York.

I grew up in Taiwan, otherwise named and mostly educated in Chinese Mandarin. My grandparents and 80% of Taiwanese in their generation speak/spoke Taiwanese Hokkien, a.k.a. Tâigí, but only 39% of Taiwanese in my generation speak this language. Since grown up, I have been striving to pick up Tâigí and adopted my Tâigí name, Hing Ong, or Ông Hîng in its traditional surname-first format with tonal notation. I presented my master thesis in Tâigí.
