Welcome! I’m Hing Ong — Atmospheric Scientist, Modeler, and STEM Educator.

I’m an independent researcher driven by a deep curiosity about the Earth’s atmosphere and a passion for expanding access to science. My work lies at the intersection of atmospheric dynamics and modeling, where I’ve advanced our understanding of key phenomena such as the [Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO)](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/), [intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/), [atmospheric rivers](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/), [waves](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-4/), and [convection](https://hingong.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-5/).

Whether unraveling the complexities of the tropical atmosphere or pushing the boundaries of model development, I strive to build tools and frameworks that enhance our ability to predict weather and climate. My research spans a range of modeling approaches from idealized to cutting-edge climate models and has helped improve how physical processes are represented in state-of-the-art systems. These efforts not only advance science but also empower others in the field to refine and innovate their own models.

As an educator, I’m passionate about nurturing critical thinking, creativity, and scientific curiosity. I’ve taught Earth system sciences at the university level, mentored students from diverse backgrounds, and championed inclusive, student-centered teaching. One of my proudest accomplishments is pioneering STEM education in Tâigí (Taiwanese Hokkien), a language rarely used in science. Through original Tâigí-language materials and global online tutoring, I support Tâigí-speaking students and bring science to communities that are often overlooked.

At the heart of everything I do is a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. I believe science thrives when everyone has a seat at the table and the tools to succeed.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore my work, reach out with questions, or connect about collaboration, mentoring, or outreach.
